# AceCode.social

Combining vibe coding, attempto controlled english (ace) and the social web - form space on the social web through words, secured by attempto controlled english.

You are only able to run code based on [attempto controlled english (ace)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempto_Controlled_English), which is a formally defined subset of the english language.
In the future, admins could through this restrict certain kinds of code from executing for security purposes.
Additionally, it lessens the ambiguity of natural language and you can be sure that the resulting code will do what it should.

Here are a few example commands in ACE that could be run on AceCoding.social in the future:

- Moderation: If a user posts more than 20 times in 1 hour then the system temporarily restricts the user's posting ability.
- Look and feel: If a post contains an image then the system displays the image with rounded corners.
- For content curation: Every post that has more than 50 likes is added to the "Popular Today" collection.
- For notifications: If a user has not logged in for 7 days then the system sends a digest of missed interactions.
- For accessibility: Every image in a post has an alt-text that is either provided by the user or generated by the system.
